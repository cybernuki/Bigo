# Bigo
It is a own testing program to check out the functionality of sorting algorithms.

I created due a holberton project bout Big O and sorting algorithms.

Actually, it only test the follow algorithms:
* Bubble sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort

## How to use it:
Basically, you write your algorithm in the function of the corresponding algorithm file in this [directory](https://github.com/cybernuki/Bigo/tree/master/answers).
For example, if you want to test your Bubble Sort, you must write your code in the function in this [file](https://github.com/cybernuki/Bigo/blob/master/answers/0-bubble_sort.c).

Once you're done, execute the *build_exe.sh* script, it will compile the program, execute and also save the result in a log file.

And that is, hope it would be useful for you.
